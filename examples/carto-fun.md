# CARTO Fun with SF health inspection data


Basically, this CARTO tutorial from last year: [Getting Started with Carto Builder](http://2016.padjo.org/tutorials/carto-getting-started/)


Except, instead of USGS earthquake data, use SF health inspection data:

- [violations.csv](https://github.com/dannguyen/sf-restaurant-inspections-sql-gis-fun/raw/master/data/violations_plus.csv)
